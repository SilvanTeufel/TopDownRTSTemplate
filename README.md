# Unreal Engine Plugin Source Files

This repository contains the source files for the Unreal Engine plugin. If you are in need of the full plugin project, including example blueprints and levels, you're in the right place.

## Download Link for the Full Plugin Project

If you require a download link for the complete plugin project, please send an email to [info@teufel-engineering.com](mailto:info@teufel-engineering.com), and I will provide you with a Google Link containing the plugin content, example blueprints, and levels.

## Usage

With these source files, you can create a plugin on your own and replace the existing source folder. To set up:

1. Right-click on the Project File.
2. Choose "Generate Visual Studio Project Files".
3. Compile the plugin in the Unreal Engine Editor.
4. Once successfully compiled, you can create blueprints from these classes.

Remember, if you purchase the plugin from the Epic Games Store, it already includes example blueprints and levels for a more seamless setup.

## Documentation

For a detailed understanding of the classes, refer to the documentation available at [wiki.teufel-engineering.com](http://wiki.teufel-engineering.com). I aim to keep the documentation updated regularly.
